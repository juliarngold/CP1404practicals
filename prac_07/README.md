##### Key Lessons Learned

- Importance of Code Readability: Consistently applying naming conventions, indentation, and spacing makes code more understandable and easier to maintain.
- Refactoring and DRY Principle: Regularly refactoring code and following the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle minimizes redundancy and reduces the chance of errors.
- Using Comments and Docstrings: Writing clear comments and docstrings helps future developers (and myself) understand the purpose of functions, classes, and complex code segments.
